        <h1>Let's Share a Few Glasses of Lemonade</h1>
        <p id="intro">Though rarely pleasant at the time, life's lemons are often the best stories in hindsight.  Sometimes, the stories themselves are the lemonade.  Other times, it's the unexpected, happy outcome.  These are some of my more memorable glasses.  Cheers!</p>

                <p>In this first example, it isn't the story itself that is the best &quot;lemonade.&quot;  The lemonade is a dog that changed my life.  How does a speeding ticket lead to a dog?  Well, a friend and I were on a motorcycle road trip, heading across Missouri on I-70.  We were pulled over by a State Trooper just north of Jefferson City and issued citations for speeding.  My friend paid his ticket, but I chose to head back to Jefferson City and fight mine.  I still maintain my innocence.
                </p>
                <p>The judge agreed to keep it off my (otherwise perfect &#128519;) driving record, in exchange for community service.  I chose to do my &quot;time&quot; at the local animal shelter, which is how I met the dog that would change my life.  Batman was my steadfast companion for 7 years through thick and thin, until he got cancer in 2019.  If it weren't for that speeding ticket, our paths never would have crossed.  This isn't a long story, but it's a great excuse to share photos of my dog.

                    <figcaption><em>I don't have a decent picture of the car, so here's my Blockbuster card from the same era.</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Now, in this instance it is the story itself that is the reward.  It's a good one, a true comedy of errors with a string of bad luck. I'll try to condense it to the bullet points, though this may make it seem even more incredulous:
                </p>
                <p>It was during the Great Recession, so I had moved back home with my parents in the northwest Chicago suburbs.  I had gone to the south suburbs to visit friends.  We lost track of time and suddenly it was 3:00AM.  It began to rain as I was leaving.  It rained like I've never seen it rain.  The sky overhead had turned into one giant, continous waterfall.  In spite of how tired I was and in spite of the biblical downpour, I made the decision to still try to head home in my rickety mid 90's Ford Escort.
                </p>
                <p>The water was rising so fast.  I made it a couple miles before my car began to shudder and misfire.  It was flooded.  The road was flooded.  Everything was flooded.  I limped my car onto a side street and flagged down strangers for help, strangers also stranded.  They called the police, who picked me up and dropped me off at a gas station a few miles further down the road.
                </p>
                <p>I waited inside for the rain to slow down, and then called my parents from a payphone outside.  I told them what happened and to wait until morning to come get me.  All the local highways and expressways were closed due to flooding anyway.  I spent the rest of the night pacing and shivering in the gas station in my soaking wet clothes.
                </p>
                <figure class="rightImage">
                    <img src="images/worstday.jpg" alt="'This is the worst day of my life... so far'">
                    <figcaption><em>Representation of an actual exchange my father had with me that morning.</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Around 8:00AM, my father showed up and drove me back to where my car was parked.  But there was only an empty parking space.  So we drove to the police station, explained the situation.  They assured us it wasn't stolen, but illegally towed by a shady tow company that was notorious, and disliked by the police.  They made a phone call on my behalf and then sent me to the tow lot, assuring us there would be no charge for the tow.
                </p>
                <p>The tow lot was an hour in the wrong direction from home.  I was very over the whole ordeal by now and just wanted to sleep.  We pulled up to the tow lot address... and it was an abandoned warehouse. No forwarding address.  It wasn't in the best area to begin with.  We drove around until we found a small bar a few blocks away, where we asked about the tow company. Locals seemed to share the same impression and opinion of this company as the police.  The company had moved, and they knew where. Armed with the correct address, we drove just a few more blocks.  We announced who we were and that the police had sent us. There was no charge.
                </p>
                <p>It was a fight to stay awake on the now 2 hour drive home.  I slept for 16 hours.  The end.

                <h3><a name="gas"></a>The Time That I Didn't Have Enough Gas</h3>
                <p>The reward in this story is an extraordinary act of human kindness.  I was a sophomore at a small college in south Minneapolis at the time, though this story takes place in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  I had decided to visit friends there over Memorial Day weekend.  As a poor college student, I had very carefully calculated the fuel needed for the journey and decided I had just enough cash to make the trip.
                </p>
                <p>I didn't have the Ford Escort from my flood story yet.  I was still driving my first car, a 1986 Oldmobile Cutlass Sierra. Leather bench seats.  No air conditioning. No ABS or traction control. No horn or radio. No power locks.  The thing was a tank- a tank without creature comforts or fuel economy.
                </p>
                <p>Heading back to school on Monday after our weekend together, I unwittingly made a wrong turn shortly after leaving my friends' house. I drove forty-five minutes before I saw a sign that read, &quot;Welcome to Houghton.&quot;  I panicked.  Houghton is one of the most northern towns of the UP.  I didn't have the gas or budget for a three hour (de)tour.
                </p>
                <figure class="leftImage">
                    <img src="images/houghton.jpg" alt="'Welcome to Houghton... The end of the line.'">
                    <figcaption><em>I mean, basically...</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>While trying to control my breathing, I pulled into the first gas station I saw and went in to ask for directions.  I said I needed the most direct route to get me pointed towards Minneapolis. I was making that face outloud that betrays inner terror, and managed to choke out to the gas station attendant that I was afraid I wasn't going to have enough money to make it.  Another customer overheard our exchange, and laid her American Express on the counter.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Go fill up,&quot; she said to me gently.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;What??&quot; I was stunned.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;Go fill up. I'll wait here.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>When I returned after filling up, she handed me a $20.  She wished me well, and then she went on her way.  That was nearly 20 years ago, and that generosity has still left a mark on me.  I try to pay it forward whenever I can, because I know first hand the power of a random act of kindness.
                </p>
                <p>Footnote: It was Memorial Day weekend.  Of course I hit traffic when I got close to Minneapolis.  Even if I hadn't gotten lost, I had miscalculated from the beginning.  My fuel budget didn't account for holiday traffic jams.  If I hadn't gotten lost and come across that stranger and her kindess, I would have ran out of gas.

                    <figcaption><em>I don't have a photo with my friend from this story, but here's one with my roommates who were lucky enough to have different plans for Christmas.</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It was 2004 and I was doing a non-profit internship in Brisbane, Australia.  My friend and coworker had invited me to join her at her parents' home in the outback for Christmas.  I walked to her house the afternoon we were set to leave and helped her finish packing her car for the road trip.  Of course, this included bringing her laundry, as is the tradition around the world of young adults going home to visit their parents.  (That information will become pertinent later in this story.)
                </p>
                <p>Once the car was loaded and we were ready to go... Well, my friend began patting the pockets of her shorts.
                </p>
                <p>&quot;I must have left the keys inside,&quot; she said.
                </p>
                <p>We headed in and she looked around.  She checked the table, the floor around the table, her pockets again, turned her backpack nearly inside out. Cushions were pulled out. Bathroom counters checked. We headed back out to the car and checked the cupholders and under the seats.  Eventually, we pulled everything back out of the car, and she went through her packed bag, and around the lining of the trunk.  No keys.  Back into the house to check again.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>This went on for nearly an hour before she caved and called a locksmith.  It was going to be after dark before we got to her parents by now.  The locksmith showed up and had to disassemble the driver's side door in order to access the key code, which he then used to cut a new key from scratch.  The key worked! My friend was out $200 for the trouble, and we were finally on our way!
                </p>
                <p>The next morning at her parents' house, as my friend was doing her laundry, she found her keys in the front pocket of a pair of jeans.
